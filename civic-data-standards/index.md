## Civic Data Standards

### Introduction

A civic data standard is a set of resources which enable interoperability between data providers - typically governments - and data consumers. When a data provider is seeking to publish information, making it available in alignment with a civic data standard (if one exists) can help jumpstart its consumption. Civic data standards also make it easier for data consumers - particularly individuals or small businesses - consume data from multiple providers without expending as much energy on technical development.

Depending on the level of interoperability needed, civic data standards generally fall into two buckets:

* *Schematics* standards define a common structure for how the information is shared, but do not attempt to ensure that the meaning of the contained information is consistent between publishers.
* *Semantic* standards define consistent meanings for the information being shared, but do not always ensure that the structure of the information is consistent between publishers.

The best civic data standards address both of these needs, but there are many which address only one or the other.

Note for technologists: while a few civic data standards describe interactive (query/response) application programming interfaces (APIs), most are designed for bulk data transfers.

### The List
Below is the list of civic data standards we have identified to-date. They vary greatly in terms of active communities, current use, and approaches used for development. This list will be revised to reflect the additional standards we discover, as well as to include more details about each standard as we research them.

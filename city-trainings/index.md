This page is designed to collect data training resources from city governments. Curated by GovEx, governments can submit training materials including course syllabi, slides, videos, and work products related to building data skills. 

This page will be organized by training topic to include major elements of data learning.<b> To make contributions, please fill out this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/LrBey5hhyR2Gqx7z2" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.</b> Please submit a new entry for each new resource in the repository. The Google Form requires a topic, a title, a one sentence description, a resource type, and places for you attach any documents to include (more than one is acceptable). For an example, see the first entry below.

This page is designed to be collaborative and iterative so layout, topics, and content may change. If you have questions or ideas on improving this page, please reach out to Eric Reese at <a href="mailto:ereese@jhu.edu">ereese@jhu.edu</a>.

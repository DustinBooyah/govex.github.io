# Responding to Open Data Concerns

Cities starting down the path of opening data often have concerns about  releasing  data to the public. This document compiles some of the most common concerns we have heard about opening data. Along with these frequently cited issues, we have included technical responses, philosophical responses, and an example from a city for each concern to help other cities respond to these arguments. 

**Note**: This document is intended to be collaborative. If you have other concerns you want to highlight, additional philosophic or technical responses to open data concerns, or great examples of responding to a concern from your city, please share them.

# Responding to Open Data Concerns

Cities starting down the path of opening data often have concerns about  releasing  data to the public. This document compiles some of the most common concerns we have heard about opening data. Along with these frequently cited issues, we have included technical responses, philosophical responses, and an example from a city for each concern to help other cities respond to these arguments. 

<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
     <h3 class="panel-title">1. Someone will reengineer the data to get personal infromation</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <div style="font-family: monospace">
If we open our data, someone could identify individuals and then use that to harm them. This is also referred to as the mosaic effect.

      <dt>Philosophical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        Personal data should be protected and we must have strong governance practices to ensure that we are releasing data that should be released.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Technical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        We can aggregate data to ensure that private information is protected. There are a variety of other approaches that can be included in a city’s plan to manage the risk of opening data.

      <dt>City Example</dt>
      <dd>
         Many cities aggregate crime data to the nearest intersection or block level when it is released (for example Seattle uses the “Hundred Block Level”). This allows critical information on public safety to be available to the public without identifying individuals.

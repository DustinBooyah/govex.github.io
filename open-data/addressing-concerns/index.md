# Responding to Open Data Concerns

Cities starting down the path of opening data often have concerns about  releasing  data to the public. This document compiles some of the most common concerns we have heard about opening data. Along with these frequently cited issues, we have included technical responses, philosophical responses, and an example from a city for each concern to help other cities respond to these arguments.

     <h3 class="panel-title">1. Someone will reengineer the data to get personal infromation</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <div style="font-family: monospace">
If we open our data, someone could identify individuals and then use that to harm them (referred to as the mosaic effect).

      <dt>Philosophical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        Personal data should be protected and we must have strong governance practices to ensure that we are releasing data that should be released.
      </dd>
      <dt>Technical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        We can aggregate data to ensure that private information is protected. There are a variety of other approaches that can be included in a cityâ€™s plan to manage the risk of opening data.
      </dd>
      <dt>City Example</dt>
      <dd>
         Many cities aggregate crime data to the nearest intersection or block level when it is released (for example Seattle uses the <a href="https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-Police-Report-Incident/7ais-f98f">Hundred Block Level</a>). This allows critical information on public safety to be available to the public without identifying individuals.

     <h3 class="panel-title">2.Our data will say we are doing poorly</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <div style="font-family: monospace">
We are not doing well and opening data will expose us to criticism from the public.
    </div>

	  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Philosophical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        Hard-working city leaders and staff should never be satisfied with poor performance. Releasing this information can encourage self-correcting behavior, help the public understand our challenges, and generate  stronger partnerships with stakeholders.
      </dd>
      <dt>Technical Response</dt>
      <dd>
        We can contextualize information by telling the story around the data. Contextualized data can also help make the case for additional resources or alternative solutions.
      </dd>
      <dt>City Example</dt>
      <dd>
         Many cities release datasets with explanations and important contextual information as a sort of justification of their data. This allows cities to demonstrate the action they are taking to address challenges and improve performance while promoting transparency and opening lines of communication with the public.

**Performance-Based Budgeting**
------------------------
### What Is Performance-Based Budgeting?

Performance-based budgeting is the allocation of funds based on programmatic results that contribute to organizational goals. For governments, performance-based budgeting uses evidence to maximize the allocation of funds toward programs that work and away from those that don’t. Performance-based budgeting is not intended to punish or reward departments or agencies, but instead to focus on progress toward measurable goals during the budget process. This approach allows cities to make and justify budgetary changes that meet community needs and advance citywide priorities, instead of defaulting to the status quo.

After hearing the call for a new way to budget, Johns Hopkins University Center for Government Excellence has created this guide, detailing performance-based budgeting and describing how it can be tied into new or existing performance management and analytics programs. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following the steps described in this guide, cities will have a greater understanding of performance-based budgeting and be well on their way to rethinking how budgeting can work for them.

Terminology

What GovEx refers to as performance-based budgeting is known by a variety of names: outcome-based budgeting, results-based budgeting, or priority-based budgeting. All of these terms indicate a focus on increasing the use of data and evidence to improve the allocation of resources and achieve programmatic and community goals. This guide uses performance-based budgeting for the sake of clarity and consistency.

Performance-based budgeting allows cities to strengthen the budgetary process in light of competing claims for resources by using objective criteria to:

* determine resource allocation;
* ensure accountability among those responsible for management;
* shift the budget focus to city priorities rather than department- or agency-specific goals;
* make the budget process more transparent; and
* engage the community in the budgeting process.

Especially in times of fiscal constraint, performance-based budgeting helps cities focus on funding programs that advance progress on the determined goals and priorities.

Cities with established performance management systems are well-positioned to take on performance-based budgeting. Cities can incorporate performance budgeting into existing performance management programs, linking budgetary requests to their publicly stated performance goals to truly align resources with results. The guidelines below are not meant to replace a city’s budget process, but are proposed as components that can be integrated into the budget process to more closely align budgeting with city priorities and goals.

### Principles for Implementation

Implementing performance-based budgeting is a process that requires clearly defined city priorities and goals, an understanding of performance measurement, and dedicated staff and city resources. Most importantly, implementation takes time, and cities should expect to spend at least one budget cycle preparing for the implementation of performance-based budgeting. Executive leadership commitment is critical; as with many city projects, performance-based budgeting will not succeed without it. Having an executive leader involved in the process signals to the rest of the organization that performance-based budgeting is the way the city is approaching budgeting, frequently alleviating buy-in and culture change concerns and unifying elected officials, senior leadership, and city staff around budget goals.

The principles listed below are designed to help cities think through key issues as they launch performance-based budgeting initiatives. Each principle includes an example from a city that is currently doing performance-based budgeting. These examples are simple ways to conceptualize the principles, but the practical application may differ across cities due to any number of factors, including form of government, organizational structure, and staff capacity and involvement.

**_1. Determine a method for aligning performance-based budgeting with the current budget cycle and process and think about messaging the changes internally early in the process._**

Since cities already have budget processes that have been in place for decades, ensuring that the transition to performance-based budgeting is as logistically seamless as possible is important for successful adoption and implementation. Aligning the new process with existing schedules and procedures can make it easier for employees to adjust to performance-based budgeting. This also helps ensure that employees focus on progress toward goals--the crux of performance-based budgeting--rather than logistical changes.

In 2011, Baltimore, MD, was very clear in messaging the move to [performance-based budgeting](http://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/OutcomeBudgeting.aspx) to city staff and officials and aligning this process to its previous budgeting schedule. This required [reframing the budget conversation](http://www.aabpa.org/assets/Symposia/2014_Summer_Symposium_July10-2014/kleine_outcome%20budgeting%20in%20baltimore%20aabpa%207.10.14.pdf) from considering last year’s spending on agency goals and debating what to cut to focusing on next year’s strategic goals for citywide priorities and debating what is worth keeping in the budget. In Baltimore, performance-based budgeting is connected to its CitiStat program, strategic plan, and agency performance agreements and aligns with the city’s goal of being a performance-based city so it seemed like a natural addition to city staff.

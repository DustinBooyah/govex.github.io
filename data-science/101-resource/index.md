# What Is Data Science?

Data Science is use of data to answer a scientific question. Scientific questions are not limited to experiments in laboratories - they occur any time a person or organization asks a question and seeks to answer that question in a way that can be verified, explained, or theorized based on the analysis of information. Because data science involves many different but related domains (i.e., computer science, quantitative analysis, statistics, communications), there is a lot packed into the field of data science.

The purpose of this guide is to provide a brief overview of the courses, concepts, and resources anyone interested in advancing their knowledge of data science should/could leverage. The mention of any particular course is not an endorsement, but simply an acknowledgement. There are many other resources outside the items mentioned here and using this guide as a launching point for additional research can help identify other potential data science learning options.

## Data Science Courses

If you want to become a bonafide Data Scientist, there are many routes and options available to you. For a list of Data Science programs across the United States, offered by major universities and colleges, check out <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/data-science-programs-us" target="_blank">this data visualization</a>. The table below shows some of the most popular online/in-person offerings for those wishing to do it on their own. Many colleges and universities offer similar programs, often through statistics or business departments, so check with your local universities and professors to see if there are any local offerings that can help meet data science needs.

## Data Science Key Concepts

Not everyone wants to be a Data Scientist, but plenty of people want to strengthen their skills in the underlying competencies. It’s possible to learn key concepts in data science without going through a full-fledged program like those mentioned above. For a high-level overview of some key (and commonly confusing) terms, check out the <a href="https://github.com/govex/Data-Science">GovEx Data Science Cheat Sheet</a>). The list below includes the subject areas which are often taught in data science coursework.

The internet is rich with resources for learning data science. Plus, the community is an active one... so join in and get involved! Liberally use sites like StackXchange, R Bloggers, GitHub, and even Twitter to start learning from your peers, no matter your skill level as a data scientist.
